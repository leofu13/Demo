# Pandas Intro

---

* This is a very rudimentary Pandas dataframe that I've created to familiarize myself with the syntax. The dataframe contains the name, origin, and score of each coffee that is depicted. 

* Additionally, I've also found the mean of the scores. 


---

* Below is the code that is used to find the average of the scores within the dataframe.

```python
Score = df['Score'].mean()

print("MeanScore:", Score)

```
